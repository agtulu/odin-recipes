    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>    
    <ul>
        <li>12 whole wheat lasagna noodles (or any noodle of your choice)</li>
        <li>1lb lean ground beef</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic (chopped)</li>
        <li>Dried oregano (to taste)</li>
        <li>Garlic powder (to taste)</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper (to taste)</li>
        <li>16oz cottage cheese</li>
        <li>Paramesan cheese (shredded)</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>4.5 cups tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups mozzarella cheese (shredded)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 175 degrees C (or 350 degrees F).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add your lasagna noodles and cook for a minute less than package instructions. Then drain and put to the side.</li>
        <li>Whilst the noodles are cooking, place the ground beef with all the spices in a large skillet over medium heat, cook and stir constantly until spices are coating
            and the beef is cooked to until brown, should be about same amount of time as the noodles.
        </li>
        <li>Mix your cheeses and eggs together in a large bowl until homogeneous.</li>
        <li>Lay 4 noodles side by side at the bottom of a appropriately sized baking pan, add a layer of the tomato sause, a layer of your beef and then the cheese mixture.
            Repeating the layering until twice more. Add a layer of shredded cheese mixture to the top and cover the top of the baking pan with a layer of a tin foil so the
            foil is slightly bleeding over the edge.
        </li>
        <li>Place the baking pan in the preheated oven (see step 1) and take out when you see the cheese has melted and you might hear some bubbling. Remove the foil and bake
            for a further 10mins until the cheese is starting to brown. Wait another 10mins before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
